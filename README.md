# Week-02-Challenge

## Overview

This project was a big change step up from last week since we actually got to design the look of this website.
I made a wireframe that divides the website into 3 main parts

-Header 
-Bio
-Content

### Header

I attached a royalty free image and put it under the text which functions as the title of the page.

### Bio

I decided the bio should be a smaller side bar on the screen so after setting it to 25% width of the screen I uploaded a rounded picture of myself and filled the rest of the sidebar with Lorem Epsom text.

### Content

My intent going in was to have a picture of the Horiseon website from week 1's challenge with some placeholder images over the contact links but after a lenghty battle with CSS this is what i finished with

### Conclusion

This is a project I will going back to complete it the way I had imagined it. Seeing a drawing turn into code and design the look was one of the more enjoyable parts of the course up until this point.
